## Project Overview

**BlackWave** is a next-generation, open-source AI-powered social network simulator. It creates a fully immersive, private social media experience where you are the only real user, surrounded by thousands (or millions) of AI-driven bots. These bots have unique personalities, memories, and behaviors, simulating real social dynamics, audience growth, and content interaction. BlackWave is ideal for:
- Content creators and strategists
- Social psychology researchers
- Developers and AI enthusiasts
- Anyone who wants to experience being the center of a social network

**Key Concepts:**
- One real user, millions of bots
- Bots with unique avatars, bios, personalities, and memory
- Realistic reactions: likes, dislikes, comments, reposts, support, hate, and more
- Audience growth and analytics
- All data is local and private

---

## Features
- **AI-Powered Bots:** Each bot has a unique profile, memory, and personality (fan, hater, neutral, humorous, etc.)
- **LLM Integration:** Supports OpenAI, Google Gemini, Ollama, OpenRouter, and more for bot intelligence
- **Bot Memory:** Uses Qdrant vector database for persistent, context-aware bot memory
- **Realistic Social Simulation:** Bots interact, comment, like, repost, and "learn" from your actions
- **Audience Growth:** Simulates organic audience expansion and engagement
- **Admin Panel:** Full-featured Django admin for user and content management
- **API-First:** RESTful API for all core features
- **Mobile-Friendly Web UI:** Responsive, modern frontend
- **Dockerized:** One-command setup with Docker Compose
- **Privacy-First:** All data is stored locally; no external data sharing
- **Extensible:** Easily add new bot types, LLMs, or features

---

## Architecture

BlackWave consists of two main services:

1. **Social Network Backend (Django):**
   - Handles user registration, authentication, posts, comments, analytics, and admin panel
   - Exposes REST API for frontend and bot system
2. **Bot System (FastAPI):**
   - Manages bot creation, behavior, memory, and LLM integration
   - Communicates with the social network backend via secure API
   - Handles all AI/LLM requests, Qdrant memory, and bot scheduling

**Supporting Services:**
- **MySQL:** Main relational database for user and content data
- **Qdrant:** Vector database for bot memory and semantic search
- **Docker Compose:** Orchestrates all services for easy local or production deployment

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/metimol/BlackWave
   cd BlackWave
   ```
2. **Copy and configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root folder:
     ```powershell
     copy .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` to add your API keys and adjust settings as needed (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).
3. **Start all services with Docker Compose:**
   ```powershell
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - Social network: http://localhost:8000
   - Admin panel: http://localhost:8000/admin
   - Bot system (API): http://localhost:9000/docs
4. **Register your user:**
   - The first user to register becomes the Admin.
   - Fill out your profile and start posting!

## Environment Variables

BlackWave uses a single `.env` file, but variables are grouped by service:
- **FastAPI Bot System** (`bot-system/app/core/settings.py`)
- **Django Social Network** (`social-network/blackwave/settings.py`)

## OpenAI, Gemini, and LLM Integrations

BlackWave supports multiple LLM providers for bot intelligence and content generation:

- **OpenAI:** Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`. Supports GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.
- **Google Gemini:** Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in `.env`.
- **Ollama:** Set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` for local LLMs (e.g., Llama 2, Mistral).
- **OpenRouter:** Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for OpenRouter LLMs.

**How to use:**
- Add your API key(s) to `.env`.
- The bot system will auto-detect available providers and use the best available.
- You can mix and match providers; bots will use whichever is available.
- If no API keys are set, bots will use fallback logic or offline generation (less advanced).

**Security:**
- API keys are never exposed to the frontend or stored in logs.
- All LLM requests are routed through the bot system backend.

---

## Bot Logic and Memory (Qdrant)

- **Bot Personalities:** Each bot is assigned a personality (fan, hater, neutral, humorous, provocative, etc.) at creation, based on `BOT_PERSONALITY_DISTR`.
- **Memory:** Bots use Qdrant (vector DB) to store semantic memories of user actions, posts, and interactions. This enables context-aware, realistic responses.
- **Behavior:**
  - Bots decide to like, comment, dislike, or repost based on probabilities (`BOT_LIKE_PROB`, etc.) and their personality.
  - Comments and reactions are generated using LLMs, with context from bot memory.
  - Audience grows over time, controlled by `BOT_GROWTH_RATE`.
- **Customization:**
  - You can adjust bot behavior, memory, and growth via environment variables.
  - Add new personalities or tweak distributions for research or fun.

---

## API Keys and Authentication

- **API_KEY:** Internal key for secure communication between Django and FastAPI services. Set to any random string; must match in both services.
- **User Authentication:**
  - Uses JWT tokens (via Djoser) for user login and API access.
  - Admin panel is protected; only the first user is superuser by default.
- **LLM API Keys:**
  - Only required for advanced bot intelligence.
  - Never exposed to users or stored in the database.

---

## Database and Storage

- **MySQL:** Stores all user, post, comment, and analytics data.
- **Qdrant:** Stores vector embeddings for bot memory and semantic search.
- **Media:** User avatars and images are stored locally (can be configured).
- **Backups:** Use standard MySQL and Qdrant backup tools for data safety.

## Admin and User Logic

- **Registration:** First user to register becomes Admin (superuser)
- **Admin Panel:** Full Django admin at `/admin` for managing users, posts, bots, analytics
- **User Roles:**
  - Only one real user (you); all others are bots
  - Admin can moderate, view analytics, and manage content
- **API:**
  - RESTful API for all core features (see `/api/` endpoints)
  - Bot system uses secure API to interact with social network backend

---

## Advanced and Optional Features

- **Public Mode:** Set `PUBLIC_MODE=true` to allow public read-only access (only you can post)
- **Custom Bot Themes:** Use `BOT_THEME` to change avatar/bio style (e.g., `anime`, `cyberpunk`)
- **Offline Generation:** Bots can generate avatars and bios offline (no external API required)
- **LLM Fallback:** If no API keys are set, bots use local logic for basic interaction
- **Analytics:** View detailed stats on engagement, bot reactions, and audience growth
- **Extensibility:**
  - Add new bot personalities or behaviors in `bot-system/app/services/`
  - Add new LLM providers in `bot-system/app/clients/llm/`

---

## Testing and Development

- **Run tests (Django):**
  ```powershell
  docker-compose exec BlackWave-social-network python manage.py test
  ```
- **Run tests (Bot System):**
  ```powershell
  docker-compose exec BlackWave-bot-system pytest
  ```
- **Manual setup (advanced):**
  - You can run each service manually for development (see Dockerfiles and requirements.txt)
  - Use virtualenv, install dependencies, and run servers as needed

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Ports in use:** Make sure ports 8000 (Django), 9000 (Bot API), 3306 (MySQL), and 6333 (Qdrant) are free
- **Database errors:** Check MySQL and Qdrant logs for startup issues
- **LLM errors:** Ensure your API keys are valid and not rate-limited
- **Docker issues:** Try `docker-compose down -v` to reset all volumes and containers
- **Logs:**
  - Django logs: `docker-compose logs BlackWave-social-network`
  - Bot system logs: `docker-compose logs BlackWave-bot-system`
